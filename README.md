# mix-n-match

A simple card matching game, developed as part of a Theory of Computer Games class at University of Veliko Tarnovo.

# Development

Due to the fact that the story is loaded dynamically and browser security, a local server is needed for development. To get it running you need to [install Node.js first](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then to setup the project, go to the project root directory (where this README.md file is) and run

    npm install grunt

Then you're ready to go. Type:

    grunt

And you'll have the game run locally and opened in the browser. Whenever you make changes to the code, the server will update it automatically.
